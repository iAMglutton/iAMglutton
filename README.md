- 👋 Hi, I’m @iAMglutton. Yeah, you heard it right!!! "Glutton" - A glutton with heavy apetite for exciting projects and researches going around the world. Just started eating in CS.
- 👀 My exciting knowledge diet contains a major amount of Artificial Intelligence and Web Development technologies. Although these 2 ingredients are kinda heavy, I try to adjust a comfortable amount of Competitive coding too! 
- 🌱 Bit by bit I'm eating all the knowledge about these domains. In recent future, idk when, but soon, I'll start uploading some very exciting projects that i'll work on throughought all the eating session.
- 💞️ Once got comfortable with the gains of my current diet, would look for eating partners too!
- 📫 Happy eating to all!
